# Text-To-Speech

This repository contains a collection of Text-To-Speech (TTS) models and related resources. The models are designed to convert text input into natural-sounding speech. 

## Models
- **Model A**: A high-quality TTS model that supports multiple languages and accents.
- **Model B**: A lightweight TTS model optimized for real-time applications.


## Key Features

- High-quality, natural-sounding speech synthesis.
- Easy to integrate into various applications.
- Open-source and customizable.
- Compatible with popular machine learning frameworks.


## Requirements

1. You need to have python3.11 (or later) installed and Google Text-to-Speech library, you can install Google Text-to-Speech as:

```
    pip install gtts
```

2. Clone the repo and run it as:

```
    python text-to-speech.py
```

## Disclaimer and Project Status

This project uses the gTTS library, which is an independent Python library interfacing with Google Translate's text-to-speech API. It is not affiliated with Google or Google Cloud services. For detailed documentation, see the official gTTS docs [here](https://pypi.org/project/gTTS/).

Please note this is an ongoing project. I plan to continue editing and improving the codebase over time to enhance features and functionality.
